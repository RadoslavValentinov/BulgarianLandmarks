    <p>
      In the navigation, right next to the name of the web application (Guide), there is a button for all options, if the user is not registered, some are missing
      options as can be seen in the attached screenshots below. Registered users have options to suggest a landmark (User suggestion is added only after admin approval) for now users 
      can add photos as a URL,
      I intend to add functionality to upload pictures in a separate database as a byte array.

    Right in the middle of the navigation bar is a field to search for information on the site.  In the right part of the navigation bar are the links for 
    registration and login (You can see them on the first screenshot).
    Directly below the navigation bar, several photos of Bulgaria's nature along the Rhodope region are visualized. The following are rankings for the most visited sights, cities and trips.

  <p>
    Next is a section with facts about Bulgaria, for the moment I have added three facts and a link to the page with "curious facts about Bulgaria". Next, 
    the footer in it has an example contact page as well as a general privacy policy (an example taken from a search of the results in Google ). On the right are links to sites from which I have drawn ideas in 
    one way or another.

    <p>
       The first option that can be selected by the user is Cities, as I have currently selected only five.
      In the first photo, located on the right are the links for additional pages.

     The next lint is events (Cultural events selected by city). In the video you can see what the page looks like. 
     For logged in users, a drop-down menu has been added with the option to add the event to the user's collection of events 
     (The second clip shows the drop-down menu with the options).

    The contacts and the email you will see are not active.

  <p>
    For logged in users, there are two more options that they can access "Add Image" is the first option 
    after the user adds the address of his image a message is displayed on the screen for successful addition and that the
    image will be visible to other users after approval by an administrator will be and added to the user's collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next section "Suggest a Landmark"
    In it, the user can add a name, description and location of the proposed landmark,
    he has to select a category from the dropdown menu as an option he can add a link to a photo or video of his choice
    (At the moment images and video can only be added with links 
    - I have an idea to add a non-  relational database and store them as a byte array ).
