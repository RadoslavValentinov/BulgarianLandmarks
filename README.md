    <p>
      In the navigation, right next to the name of the web application (Guide), there is a button for all options, if the user is not registered, some are missing
      options as can be seen in the attached screenshots below. Registered users have options to suggest a landmark (User suggestion is added only after admin approval) for now users 
      can add photos as a URL,
      I intend to add functionality to upload pictures in a separate database as a byte array.
