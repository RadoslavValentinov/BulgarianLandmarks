Hello, this is my web project related to Bulgarian landmarks, cities as an option, 
sample excursions as well as cultural events for the various cities (theatre productions, concerts, etc.) have been added.

    <p>
      In the navigation, right next to the name of the web application (Guide), there is a button for all options, if the user is not registered, some are missing
      options as can be seen in the attached screenshots below. Registered users have options to suggest a landmark (User suggestion is added only after admin approval) for now users 
      can add photos as a URL,
      I intend to add functionality to upload pictures in a separate database as a byte array.

    Right in the middle of the navigation bar is a field to search for information on the site.  In the right part of the navigation bar are the links for 
    registration and login (You can see them on the first screenshot).
    Directly below the navigation bar, several photos of Bulgaria's nature along the Rhodope region are visualized. The following are rankings for the most visited sights, cities and trips.

    Next is a section with facts about Bulgaria, for the moment I have added three facts and a link to the page with "curious facts about Bulgaria". Next, 
    the footer in it has an example contact page as well as a general privacy policy (an example taken from a search of the results in Google ). On the right are links to sites from which I have drawn ideas in 
    one way or another.
